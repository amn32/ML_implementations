# Overview

Here is a collection of the models and algorithms I have implemented in Python. Please refer to the relevant notebooks in the ML_notebooks folder for guided explanations.

Full documentation coming soon as a readthedocs webpage - full conversion to Numpy style docstring in progress

## Usage

All relevant code may be imported as follows. Module choices are neuralnets, sampling or regression

```python
from ML_implementations.module import *
```

## neuralnets

- Multi Layer Perceptron

- Multi-Task Learning

- Flexible Neural Net (can take any combination of dense or convolutional layers)

- Bayesian Neural Network

- Denoising Auto Encoder

- Variational Autoencoder

- Tensorflow Self-Organising Map

## sampling

- Metropolis-Hastings

- Hamiltonian MCMC

## regression

- OLS/PLS

- KNN Regression
